This project demonstrates a simple linear and logistic regression models through figures/graphs.
Please note the datasets have been borrowed from online resources:
Linear Regression Dataset: https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/regression/x01.txt
Logistic Regression Dataset https://gist.github.com/dormantroot/4223566

In Depth:
- Linear Regression is used to establish a relationship between Dependent and 
Independent variables, which is useful in estimating the resultant dependent 
variable in case independent variable change.

- Logistic Regression is used to ascertain the probability of an event. 
And this event is captured in binary format, i.e. 0 or 1.
